v1.3 - Added Boolean and DateTimeOffset to the list of data types supported. Changed Struple
       tests so that all 15 supported types are tested at the same time in "Struple_15".
       All of the changes are non-breaking in the sense that encoded data can still be decoded
       without any problem. The interfaces have changed so that previous derivations may need
       to be updated.

v1.2 - Cleaned up the "Struple" implementation which involved breaking changes in EncodingArgs
       and some other small things. The tests were reworked to use reflection to simplify handling
       the generic EncodingArgs. Sorry to break things like this but the sooner the better!

v1.1 - Added some simple "Struple" examples showing how to handle more complex data structures.
       A struple is just a tuple defined as a structure instead of a class. It allows up to 15
       fields of intrinsic data types (new Struple<T1, T2, ..., T15> where T : struct).
       Essentially, this just shows how to serialize multiple vectors and add the header 
       information needed to decode the entire set. It is highly recommended to instead handle
       your own data structures or classes in concrete codec derivations. But for ad hoc usage
       these additional methods can be handy in a pinch. 
       Check out the new tests added for this functionality. They're crude but they work. :-)
       Although this should not break any existing code, there was a small change to the top-level
       headers. The "numBlocks" was integer in the previous version. But it was changed to byte in
       the new version. That's because it would be extremely rare to encode more than 255 blocks in
       parallel. That leaves 3 bytes free. One of those bytes we now use to store the number of
       vectors that are encoded. That means you can encode data structures with up to 255 fields.
       The remaining two bytes we reserve as "flags". These are different than the lower-level
       "block flags". Study the sources to understand more about this. It's definitely NOT very
       complicated.
